# documentation = "https://docs.rs/bitflags" # The documentation field specifies a URL to a website hosting the crateâ€™s documentation. If no URL is specified in the manifest file, crates.io will automatically link your crate to the corresponding docs.rs page when the documentation has been built and is available (see docs.rs queue).

# [badges]
# # The `maintenance` table indicates the status of the maintenance of
# # the crate. This may be used by a registry, but is currently not
# # used by crates.io. See https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/2437
# # and https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/2438 for more details.
# #
# # The `status` field is required. Available options are:
# # - `actively-developed`: New features are being added and bugs are being fixed.
# # - `passively-maintained`: There are no plans for new features, but the maintainer intends to
# #   respond to issues that get filed.
# # - `as-is`: The crate is feature complete, the maintainer does not intend to continue working on
# #   it or providing support, but it works for the purposes it was designed for.
# # - `experimental`: The author wants to share it with the community but is not intending to meet
# #   anyone's particular use case.
# # - `looking-for-maintainer`: The current maintainer would like to transfer the crate to someone
# #   else.
# # - `deprecated`: The maintainer does not recommend using this crate (the description of the crate
# #   can describe why, there could be a better solution available or there could be problems with
# #   the crate that the author does not want to fix).
# # - `none`: Displays no badge on crates.io, since the maintainer has not chosen to specify
# #   their intentions, potential crate users will need to investigate on their own.
